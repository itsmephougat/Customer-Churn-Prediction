Customer Churn Prediction
Project Overview

This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning techniques. Customer churn prediction can help businesses proactively identify customers who are likely to leave and take actions to retain them. The project uses a dataset containing customer-related information, which is processed and analyzed to develop a predictive model for churn.
Project Structure

    Data Preprocessing: Cleans and preprocesses the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features as necessary.
    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzes the features to identify trends, correlations, and key indicators of churn.
    Model Building: Implements machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests) to predict customer churn.
    Model Evaluation: Evaluates model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC score.
